# Universal Differential Equations for Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)

Repository for the universal differential equations paper: [arXiv:2001.04385 [cs.LG]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04385).

This repository is simply a demonstration. For more up-to-date versions of these codes, see the 
[SciMLSensitivity.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/SciMLSensitivity/stable/) and
[DiffEqFlux.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqFlux/stable/) documentations. Their tutorials incorporate all of the
ideas from this repo in well-maintained and tested software!

For more software, see the [SciML organization](https://sciml.ai/) and its [Github organization](https://github.com/SciML/)
